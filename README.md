# Exhibit-Explorer
This is a project i completed as part of COMP3490 class.
It invloves 3D hierarchy and models an explorer in a gallery with observable exhibits.

## Platform

This was written on the Processing 3 platform and invloved the use of texture mapping and collision checking.

## Notes.

* Implemented four recurring texture-mapped exhibits throughout the gallery.
* Locations of exhibits were saved so collision checks would be possible. And to also prevent visitor from walking through the exhibit.
* Walls, Ceiling and floor of gallery were textur-mapped to model a real life gallery.
* Exhibits are animated with vertical and rotational motion.

## Features
* Visitors are able to explore the exhibits by hitting the w and s keys for forward and backward motion respectively, and the a, and s keys for left and right turns respectively.
* By moving cursor over the screen, the visitor is able to perform a free-look around the exhibit.

## Known Bugs
* While performing free-look, pushing movement keys A or D after moving from previous position causes the camera to snap to the default center of the screen as opposed to it having no effect on the cameta view.
